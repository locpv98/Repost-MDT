# LEARN THE BASICS
Most machine learning workflows involve (lien quan den) working with data, creating models, optimizing model parameters, and saving the trained models. This tutorial introduces you to complete ML workflow implemented (thuc hien) in PyTorch, with links
to learn more about each of these concepts (khainiem).
We''ll use the FashionMNIST dataset to train a neural network that predicts if an input image belongs to one of the following classes: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneakerm Bag, or Ankle boot.

*This tutorial assumes a basic familirity with Python and Deep Learning concepts.*
## How to Use this Guide
If you're familiar with other deep learning frameworks, check out the [00.Quickstart](https://github.com/locpv98/Repost_MDT/blob/master/Pytorch/Learn_The_Basics/docs/00.Quickstart.md)
first to quickly familiarize yourself with PyTorch's API.
