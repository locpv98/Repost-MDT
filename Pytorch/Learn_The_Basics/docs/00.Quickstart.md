## Working with data
PyTorch has two primitives (nguyen thuy) to work with data: `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` and `torch.utils.data.DataSet`. `Dataset` stores the samples
and their corresponding (tuong ung) labels, and `DataLoader` wraps an iterable (co the lap lai) around the `Dataset`.

```python
import torch  
from torch import nn  
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader  
from torchvision import datasets  
from torchvision.transforms import ToTensor, Lambda, Compose
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
PyTorch offers (cung cap) domain-specific (mien cu the) libraries such as **TorchText, TorchVision** and **TorchAudio**, all of which include datasets. For this tutorial, we will be using a TorchVision dataset.  
The `torchvision.dataset` module contains `Dataset` objects for many real-world vision data like CIFAR, COCO. In this tutorial we use the FashionMNIST dataset.  
Every TorchVision `Dataset` includes two arguments: `transform` and `target_transform` to modify the samples and labels respectively.
```python
# Download training data from open datasets.
training_data = datasets.FashionMNIST(
  root = 'data',
  train = True,
  dowload = True,
  transform = ToTensor(),
)

# Download test data from open datasets.
test_data = datasets.FashionMNIST(
  root = 'data',
  train = True,
  dowload = True,
  transform = ToTensor(),
)
```
We pass the `Dataset` as an argument to `DataLoader`. This wraps an iterable (có thể lặp lại) over our dataset, and supports automatic batching (lo hang), sampling (lay mau), shuffling (xao tron) and multiprocess data loading. Here we define a batch size of 64, i.c.each element in the dataloader iterable will return a batch of 64 features and labels.
```python
batch_size = 64

# Create data loaders.
train_dataloader = DataLoader(training_data, batch_size = batch_size)
test_dataloader = DataLoader(test_data, batch_size = batch_size)

for X, y in test_dataloader:
  print("Shape of X [N, C, H, W]:", X.shape)
  print("Shape of y: ", y.shape, y.dtype)
  break
```
Out:
```
Shape of X [N, C, H, W]: torch.Size([64, 1, 28, 28])
Shape of y: torch.Size([64]) torch.int64
```

## Creating Models
The define a neural network in PyTorch, we create a class that inherits (kethua) from **nn.Module**. We define the layers of the network in the __init__ function and spectify how data will pass throught the network in the `forward` function. To accelerate (tang toc do) operations (hoat dong) in the neural network, we move it to GPU if available.
```python
# Get cpu or gpu device for training.
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
print("Using {} device".format(device))

# Define model
class NeuralNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(NeuralNetwork, self).__init__
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.linear_relu_stack = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(28*28, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, 10),
            nn.ReLU()
        )
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.flatten(x)
        logits = self.linear_relu_stack(x)
        return logits
model = NeuralNetwork().to(device)
print(model)
```

## Optimizing the Model Parameters
To train a model, we need a [loss funtion](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#loss-functions) and on [optimizer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html).  
```python
loss_fn = nn.CrossentropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr = 1e-3)
```
In a single training loop, the model makes predictions on the training dataset (fed to it in batches), and backpropagates (truyen nguoc) the preidiction error to adjust the model's parameters.  
```python
def train(dataloader, model, loss_fn, optimizer):
    size = len(dataloader.dataset)
    for batch, (X, y) in enumerate(dataloader):
        X, y = X.to(device), y.to(device)

        # Compute prediction error
        pred = model(X)
        loss = loss_fn(pred, y)

        # Backpropagation
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        if batch % 100 ==0:
            loss, current = loss.item(), batch*len(X)
            print(f"loss: {loss:>7f} [{current:5d}/{size:>5d}]")
```
We also check the model's performance against the test datatet to ensure it is learning.
```python
def test(dataloader, model):
    size = len(dataloader.dataset)
    model.eval()
    test_loss, correct = 0,0
    with torch.no_grad():
        for X, y in dataloader:
            X, y = X.to(devide), y.to(devide)
            pred = model(X)
            test_loss += loss_fn(pred, y).item()
            correct += (pred.argmax(1) == y).type(torch.float).sum().item()
    test_loss /= size
    correct /= size
    print(f"Test Error: \n Accuracy: {(100*correct):>0.1f}%, Avg loss: {test_loss:>8f} \n")
```
The training process is conducted over several iterations (sự lặp lại) (*epoch*). During each epoch the model learns parameters to make better predictions. We print the model's accuracy and loss at each epoch: we'd like to see the accuracy increase and the loss decrease with every epoch.
```python
epochs = 5
for t in range(epochs):
    print(f"Epoch {t+1}\n---------------------")
    train(train_dataloader, moodel, loss_fn, optimizer)
    test(test_dataloader, model)
print("Done!")
```
Out:
```python
# Please see in the soure code
```

## Saving Models
A common way to save a model is to serialize (nối tiếp) the internal state dictionary (containing the model parameters).
```python
torch.save(model.stae_dict(), "model.pth")
print("Saved PyTorch Model State to model.pth")
```
Out:
```python
Saved PyTorch Model State to model.pth
```
## Loading Models
The process for loading a model includes re-creating the mode structure and loading the state dictionary into it.  
```python
model = NeuralNetwork()
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("model.pth"))
```
This model can now be used to make predictions.
```python
classes = [
    "T-shirt/top",
    "Trouser",
    "Pullover",
    "Dress",
    "Coat",
    "Sandal",
    "Shirt",
    "Sneaker",
    "Bag",
    "Ankle boot",
]

model.eval()
x, y = test_data[0][0], test_data[0][1]
with torch.no_grad():
    pred = model(x)
    prdicted, actual = classes[pred(0).argmax(0), classes[y]]
    print(f'Predicted: "{predicted}", Actual: "{actual}"')
```
