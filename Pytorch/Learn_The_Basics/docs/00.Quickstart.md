## Working with data
PyTorch has two primitives (nguyen thuy) to work with data: `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` and `torch.utils.data.DataSet`. `Dataset` stores the samples
and their corresponding (tuong ung) labels, and `DataLoader` wraps an iterable (co the lap lai) around the `Dataset`.

``
import torch
from torch import nn
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision import datasets
from torchvision.transforms import T
