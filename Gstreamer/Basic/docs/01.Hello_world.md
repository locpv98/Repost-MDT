# Goal
Nothing better to get firt inpression about a software libary than to print "Hello World' on the screen!  
But since (tu khi) we are dealing (xu li) with multimedia framework, we are going to play a video instead (thay the).  
Do not be scared by amount (so luong) of code below: there are on ly 4 lines which do _real_ work. The rest (phan con lai) is cleanup code, and, in C, this is always a bit (1 chut) verbose (dai dong).  
Without further ado, get ready for your firt GStrearmer application
# 1. Hello world
# 2. Walkthrough (huogn dan)
# 3. Conclusion (ket luan)
